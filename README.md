Homework 12: Bootstrap Scavenger Hunt for IFLScience Home Page
For this assignment, I began by picking a website and diagraming the homepage.
My goal was to get one section further than I did, but since I quickly realized that I underestimated the simplicity of the webpage,
I feel like this was a good attempt. I began my code by outlining the various sections in comments.
Then, for each component from the top of the page down, I searched Bootstrap, inserted them into my code,
and ran the program to search for errors. This was particularly tricky for the carousel,
for which I pulled the code and mini JS from w3schools.
